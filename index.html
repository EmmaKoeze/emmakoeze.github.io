      <p>
        I’m a wind turbine parts trader based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up on a farm in Central Virginia it was easy to see the stars.
        Still, I only found out much later in life that Orian’s Belt isn’t an
        asterism in the Big Dipper and meteoroids become meteorites only if they
        don't burn up in the atmosphere.</p> 
      <p>
        Back in the day I always wanted to taste every fig that grew on the
        tree just like the next person. But I realized that sometimes you just
        have to pick and eat. So here are the fruits in my basket.
